This Flutter project is a simple time picker application that allows users to select a time and display it on the screen. The app features a clean user interface with a time selection button and a "Clear" button to reset the selected time.

Key Features:
Time Picker Functionality: The app includes a time picker that allows users to select a time via the native showTimePicker widget.
Selected Time Display: Once the time is selected, it is displayed on the screen in a formatted string.
Clear Selection: A "Clear" button appears after the user selects a time, allowing them to reset the selection back to "No time selected."
State Management: The app manages the state of the selected time using setState, which updates the UI dynamically when the time is selected or cleared.
